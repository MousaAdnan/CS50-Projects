Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

The aura of the listener can be characterized by analyzing the details and attributes like danceability, energy, valence, tempo and duration of their top 100 songs.
We can average these values and thatll tell us the preferences in terms of their overall mood.

Q: Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

It might not be representative because it averages the attributes of only the top 100 songs from one year.
It's potentially missing out on variations in the listeners listening habits throughout the year or across different years.
